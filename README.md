# Function And Error
This `Error` smart contract is designed to demonstrate various error handling mechanisms in Solidity, including `require`, `assert`, and `revert`. This contract also includes basic functionality such as setting a maximum value, incrementing a counter, and dividing two numbers.  I have also included ownership checks to ensure that only the contract owner can perform certain actions and it will be safe from unauthorized
Access.
